# Repository where I am training in algorithms and data structures.
I created this project to track my own progress in learning algorithms and data structures. The project contains several common files for all algorithms:
1. `RegeneratingData.c` - generates 3 `.txt` files with testing integer data. In furure I will make template function that can create files with different types for testing data.
2. `Constants.h` - contains global constants than I use in every algorithm.
Also every folder with algorithm and data structure contains description file for myself.

## Future goals:
1. Add searching algorithms;
2. Add data structures;
3. Add template metaprogramming version for every algorithm and fix description files.
